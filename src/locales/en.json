    "description": "Pastor Roberto Goins and his family have dedicated their lives to serving the Lord. They began their ministry in South Carolina, serving the Hispanic community for almost 12 years. In 2005, they gave their lives to Christ, and their calling was strengthened by their cultural connection to Colombia, his wife's country of origin. Today, guided by God, they work in Arizona planting a church centered on the eternal principles of the Word. Their greatest desire is for every person to experience the true peace and joy found only in a relationship with Jesus Christ."
